> S.A.F.E - Searchable Apps For Everyone

> This application provides a way for people to search and rate popular applications. Users can search by genre, developer, title, and rating. Users are also able to submit requests to add applications to the catalog. This functions similarly to an app store such as Google Play but is more user-interactive.

## Database Info
Our database for this project is hosted in the cloud (with Microsoft Azure) so that we can all access it remotely from anywhere without all the trouble of maintaining a local database.

You can access the database from either Visual Studio or SQL Server Management Studio with the following information:

**Server**: h9mnds2dna.database.windows.net

**Port**:1433

**Username**: cse201

**Password**: cse_123#


*NOTE: This server has a firewall by default. If you are denied access for any reason, let me know and I will add your IP Address to the firewall rules (I know, it's a pain).*

*To connect via Visual Studio, simply click the "Add SQL Server" button and connect to a new database with the provided information. Be sure to choose "SQL Server Authentication."*


## .NET Info
This project uses the default .NET MVC Project template. Out of the box, this project includes a ton of files and information and can be very intimidating at first. However, it is actually very simple, you just have to ignore all the clutter. Let me know and I'm happy to explain the entire structure, etc.
